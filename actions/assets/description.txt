Our focus is on helping individual citizens take positive action to mitigate climate change. Individual behavior change is an integral part of driving the societal and economic changes necessary to impact climate change at a global scale. We see an unmet need for a group that connects citizens as everyday consumers, helping them make sustainable choices to drive change in the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of consumed goods and services. We also see an opportunity to connect citizens to the larger global network of climate change action, by facilitating their connection to groups such as the above.
