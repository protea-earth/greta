Greta is an agile voice assistant to help reduce your carbon footprint. She is built on top of the [Nala framework](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/nala) for prototyping voice assistant apps.

Built by [Protea](http://protea.earth), the world's leading social network community to reduce your effect on the climate.

Greta was built as a demo project for the [Climate-KIC Climathon](https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/san-francisco-the-event-page-2019) in the SF Bay Area October 25th, 2019. 

## Getting started

This section assumes you are using a Mac operating system (MacOS) on a device like an iMac / MacBook Pro.

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:protea-earth/greta.git
cd greta 
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 setup.py 
```

Now, set up some environment variables in your ./~ directory:

```
cd ~
open .bash_profile
```

These are some environment variables that you should set here: 

```
export SUDO_PASSWORD=**********
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/jimschwoebel/Desktop/appcreds/APPNAME-basdfcnas3el98a8sd5.json
```

Note the sudo_password is your password for your Mac computer to help shut down computer and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is the .json key location for the Google API to allow for Google transcription.

Now you can run:

```
python3 greta.py
```

This will start Greta up for you to now query her for some actions.

## How to query Greta

It's quite easy to query Greta. All you need to do is say "Hey Greta" and she'll wake up listening for an action. See below for more information.

![](https://github.com/protea-earth/greta/blob/master/data/other/Gif-2019-56-06-18-56-43.gif)

To active Greta, all you need to do is query her with 'Hey Greta!' (1) - which then triggers a response from Greta - (3) in this case, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?.‚Äù Then, a user provides another query (usually after some beeping sound) - such as (4) ‚Äúget events.‚Äù Greta transcribes this query to understand it, and parses the query for keyword intents; for example, if the response is ‚Äúget events‚Äù the only word that really matters is ‚Äúevents‚Äù and that would be used to provoke a response (5). Then, after this keyword maps onto an action dictionary (or a map of responses to keywords), the action is executed (6). Then, the intent loop repeats itself, looking for another wakeword (‚ÄúHey Greta‚Äù) before triggering another action.

## Actions: what Greta can do

Listed here are a description of these actions along with the query intents needed to activate them.
